# Solar System Simulation - Project Status

*Last Updated: March 16, 2025*

## Current Status: Core Implementation

The project is now in the core implementation phase. We have established the GitHub repository and set up the basic application structure.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created project directory structure
- ✅ Written comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Defined technical architecture
- ✅ Selected technology stack
- ✅ Set up package.json with dependencies
- ✅ Added GitHub capabilities to tools
- ✅ Set up GitHub repository for the project
- ✅ Implemented basic Electron window configuration
- ✅ Created scene manager with Three.js
- ✅ Implemented celestial object data models
- ✅ Created physics engine with gravity simulations
- ✅ Set up basic UI structure

## In Progress

- ⏳ Implementing object interaction functionality
- ⏳ Enhancing physics calculations for better accuracy
- ⏳ Creating advanced visualization effects

## Next Steps

1. Add collision detection and handling
2. Integrate textures for celestial bodies
3. Implement spacetime visualization
4. Add educational information panels
5. Create object creation/modification UI
6. Enhance orbit visualization
7. Create save/load system for custom simulations

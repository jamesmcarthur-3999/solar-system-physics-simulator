# Solar System Physics Simulator - Testing Guide

This document provides guidelines for testing the Solar System Physics Simulator application. It covers testing procedures, focus areas, and best practices to ensure the application functions correctly across different environments.

## Testing Focus Areas

### 1. Physics Simulation Accuracy

- **Orbital Mechanics**: Verify that objects follow proper elliptical orbits and obey Kepler's laws
- **Gravitational Calculations**: Test that gravitational forces are calculated correctly between all bodies
- **Collision Detection**: Verify that collisions are detected and handled appropriately
- **Time Scale Changes**: Test simulation behavior at different time scales (slow, normal, fast, reverse)

### 2. Visual Rendering

- **Texture Loading**: Verify that all celestial body textures load correctly
- **Lighting Effects**: Test that lighting and shadow effects render properly
- **Special Effects**: Verify atmosphere, ring systems, cloud layers, and glow effects
- **Level-of-Detail**: Test that LOD rendering functions correctly at different distances

### 3. User Interface

- **Controls Functionality**: Test all UI controls (buttons, sliders, menus)
- **Educational Features**: Verify that tours, information panels, and educational menu work correctly
- **Object Management**: Test adding, editing, and removing celestial bodies
- **Camera Controls**: Test navigation, zooming, focusing, and view reset functionality
- **System Selector**: Verify that switching between system configurations works properly

### 4. Performance

- **Frame Rate**: Monitor FPS during normal use and with many objects in the scene
- **Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks during long-running simulations
- **Resource Management**: Verify that resources are properly disposed when no longer needed
- **Optimization Settings**: Test effects of different optimization settings on performance

### 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Operating Systems**: Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
- **Hardware Variations**: Test on different GPUs and CPU configurations
- **Display Resolutions**: Verify correct rendering at different screen resolutions
- **Input Devices**: Test with various input devices (mouse, trackpad, touchscreen if supported)

## Testing Procedures

### Manual Testing

#### Basic Functionality Test

1. Launch the application
2. Check that the default solar system loads correctly
3. Verify that planets are in motion and follow accurate orbits
4. Test camera controls (rotation, pan, zoom)
5. Test time controls (play/pause, speed up, slow down)
6. Select and view information about different celestial bodies
7. Try switching between different system configurations

#### Educational Features Test

1. Open the educational menu
2. Start a guided tour and navigate through all steps
3. View several information panels and verify content accuracy
4. Test highlighting of objects during educational tours
5. Verify that all educational features are accessible and functional

#### Object Creation Test

1. Add a new celestial body with basic parameters
2. Add a celestial body with custom properties (atmosphere, rings, etc.)
3. Edit properties of an existing object
4. Delete an object and verify it's removed properly
5. Test save/load functionality with custom configurations

#### Performance Test

1. Monitor frame rate during normal operation
2. Add multiple objects (20+) and check performance
3. Increase time scale to maximum and verify stability
4. Run the simulation for an extended period (15+ minutes)
5. Check memory usage over time to detect potential leaks

### Automated Testing

For future implementation:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
- **Render Tests**: Verify correct visual output
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish baseline performance metrics

## Bug Reporting

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Environment**: Operating system, hardware configuration
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear, numbered steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Expected Behavior**: What should have happened
4. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened
5. **Visual Evidence**: Screenshots or video if applicable
6. **Logs**: Any console logs or error messages

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist for regular testing:

- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Default solar system loads correctly
- [ ] Physics simulation is accurate
- [ ] Camera controls function properly
- [ ] Time controls work as expected
- [ ] Educational features are accessible and functional
- [ ] Object creation and editing works correctly
- [ ] System switching functions properly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (stable frame rate)
- [ ] No visual glitches or rendering issues
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use
- [ ] Save/load functionality works correctly

## Future Test Automation Plans

In future development phases, we plan to implement:

1. **Automated Unit Testing**: Using Jest for component testing
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Comparing screenshots to detect UI changes
3. **Performance Testing Framework**: Automated benchmarks for physics and rendering
4. **Cross-platform CI/CD Testing**: Testing builds on multiple platforms

## Versioning and Release Testing

Before releasing a new version:

1. Complete full testing checklist on all supported platforms
2. Verify backward compatibility with saved configurations
3. Check resource usage on minimum specification hardware
4. Test installation package on clean systems
5. Verify all documentation is up-to-date with new features

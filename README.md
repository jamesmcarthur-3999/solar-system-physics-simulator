# Solar System Physics Simulator

An interactive educational desktop application that simulates our solar system with accurate physics. Users can manipulate celestial objects and observe the effects on the system, including gravity's impact on spacetime, planetary conditions, and habitability parameters.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics Engine**: N-body simulation calculating gravitational forces between all objects
- **Interactive Object Management**: Add, modify, and remove celestial bodies with custom parameters
- **Educational Features**: Real-time data display, habitability indicators, and scientific explanations
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive rendering with realistic textures and effects
- **Time Controls**: Pause, accelerate, slow down, or reverse simulation time

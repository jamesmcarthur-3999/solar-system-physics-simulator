# Solar System Physics Simulator - Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully set up the core architecture for the Solar System Physics Simulator project:

1. **Repository Structure**:
   - Created the GitHub repository
   - Set up the basic directory structure
   - Added documentation files

2. **Core Components**:
   - Created the main Electron application shell
   - Implemented the 3D scene manager with Three.js
   - Created data models for celestial objects
   - Implemented the gravity simulation physics engine
   - Built basic UI structure and controls

3. **Documentation**:
   - Project Guide
   - Data Models
   - Project Status

## Next Steps

To continue development, here are the immediate next steps:

### 1. Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository locally
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to launch the application
4. Test basic functionality

### 2. Asset Integration
1. Download textures for celestial bodies from suggested sources
2. Place textures in the `assets/textures` directory
3. Update renderer to properly use textures

### 3. Feature Development Priority

#### Phase 1 (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Enhance Physics Engine**:
   - Improve accuracy of orbital calculations
   - Add collision detection and handling
   - Implement better time scaling

2. **Improve Visualization**:
   - Add proper object scaling
   - Implement orbit lines with eccentricity
   - Create visual effects for celestial objects

3. **Expand UI Functionality**:
   - Create object details panel
   - Implement object creation dialog
   - Add camera controls for following objects

#### Phase 2 (Following 2 Weeks)
1. **Educational Features**:
   - Add information panels about celestial objects
   - Create visualization for gravity wells (spacetime distortion)
   - Implement habitability indicators

2. **Advanced Object Management**:
   - Create object editing capabilities
   - Add preset systems beyond our solar system
   - Implement object grouping (for moons, etc.)

3. **Save/Load System**:
   - Create file format for saving simulations
   - Implement export/import functionality
   - Add simulation snapshots

#### Phase 3 (Final Polish)
1. **UI Refinement**:
   - Create consistent styling
   - Improve responsive design
   - Add help system and tooltips

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement level-of-detail rendering
   - Optimize physics calculations
   - Add settings for performance tuning

3. **Packaging and Distribution**:
   - Configure builds for all platforms
   - Create installers
   - Prepare for public release

## Technical Considerations

- **ES Modules**: Ensure all imports/exports use proper ES module syntax
- **Three.js Performance**: Monitor rendering performance and optimize as needed
- **Physics Accuracy**: Balance between accuracy and performance for N-body simulations
- **Electron Security**: Follow best practices for Electron security
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test regularly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
